  description:    "The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement already has assessment guidelines and has invested in training throughout its network. However, real-time evaluations and operational reviews have indicated that the practice of needs assessments remains a challenge. This website and toolkit is to be used by all stakeholders in the Red Cross Red Crescent movement responsible for planning and implementing needs assessment after a disaster."

  paragraph1: "Needs assessment is how organizations identify and measure the humanitarian needs of a disaster-affected community. Simply put, needs assessment is the best way to answer the question: ‘What assistance do disaster-affected communities need?’"
  paragraph2: "Needs assessments use various methods to collect and analyse information. These enable the organization to make good decisions about how to allocate resources and gather more resources to meet the needs of the disaster-affected community."
